                <p>This is not an official test for COVID-19. 
                    This test is only based on your given dates,
                     your active diseases and your symptoms.
                      The company Coiner GmbH based in Switzerland 
                      does not take any responsibility or accountability 
                      for the results. The result of this test can help you 
                      to decide if you should contact your doctor or hospital.
                       The official test is then done with a blood draw or a 
                       saliva sample. We will donate a part of the earnings for 
                       researches concerned COVID-19.
